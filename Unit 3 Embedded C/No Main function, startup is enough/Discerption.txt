Main function is just convential name for the first function called after startup code
startup code after initializing the enviroment for the program it will call the main function
startup main tasks:
                    1) Initialize the stack pointer
                    2) Copy the .Data section from ROM to RAM
                    3) Reservce space in RAM for the .bss and initialize this area with zeros
                    4) Call the main function 


but in the fourth point, is that necessary to call the main function , or it's necessary to be called or named main function?
the answer is no , main function can be renamed with anything
but the name "main" is the convential name


is that necessary to call main function?
the answer is no you can write your application in the reset handler
just use the make command to create the elf and axf image and burn it to test ;)
